# Crystal Collector
## What is this?
This Web Application is a program that runs a game where the goal is to match a random number by clicking on the crystal images provided. Each crystal is assigned a random number at the beginning of each game.

## How to get started
When the webpage first loads, a number is displayed in the green box and the game begins.
The user then attempts to reach the random number by clicking on the various crystal images, which each add their respective value to the total.
The game ends when either the number is reached or surpassed, which then starts another game while logging the last game as a win or a loss.
